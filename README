A Scala Specs2 extension for testing XSLT with XSpec.

Purpose
-------

XSpec is a Behaviour Driven Development test framework that allows unit tests
to be written for XSLT and XQuery code.

Specs2 is a Scala Behaviour Driven Development test framework for writing tests
for Scala code.

In a mixed Scala/XSLT project, it's useful to be able to run all of the tests
for both the Scala code and the XSLT code together, and to see all of the results
in one place (e.g. on a continuous integration server).

So, this library provides an easy way to invoke XSpec from Specs2, and reports
the results of the XSpec tests alongside the Specs2 tests.


Usage
-----

Reference this library in your Maven POM:

  <dependency>
    <groupId>net.surguy</groupId>
    <artifactId>specs2-xspec</artifactId>
    <version>0.3_2.11</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>

or in your SBT build script:

  libraryDependencies ++= Seq("net.surguy" %% "specs2-xspec" % "0.3" % "test")

Create a Scala Specs2 specification extending XspecSpecification:

  class MySpec extends net.surguy.xspec.XspecSpecification {
    override def xSpec = new java.io.File("path/to/my.xspec")
  }

Run the Specs2 specification however you prefer - I typically use Intellij
IDEA's Specs2 support.

See the ExampleXSpecSpecification code for a working example of a Specs2
specification, and the test.xspec for example XSpec code.

Dependencies
------------

To run, this code also requires the SAXON XSLT Processor by Michael Kay,
available at http://saxon.sourceforge.net/, licensed under the MPL 1.0, and
the Specs2 code by Eric Torreborre available at
https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2 and licensed under an MIT license. Both
of these are referenced from the POM.

This code is built against specs2 2.5 2_11. If you're using a different version
of Specs2, it may or may not work.

By default, the POM references a fairly old version of Saxon - 9.1.0.8 -
because that's the latest version available in a public repository. It should
work against newer versions if you manually add them to your local Maven repo.
